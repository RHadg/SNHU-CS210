# SNHU-CS210
Project Submission for SNHU CS210
In this project for SNHU we are asked to collaborate with Airgead Banking, one of Chada Tech's clients. This application allows users to see how their investments will grow over time. 
It asks for user input for the initial investment amount, the monthly deposit, annual interest, and number of years the investment grows. The program will then create two displays: the year end balance for each year,
as well as the year end interest earned with and without additional monthly deposits. In this project I feel that I exceled in creating seperate distinct functions in the calculations.cpp and investment.cpp, and the overall design of the program. The one area to enhance would be the input validation. There is not validation of the correct type of input and the user can input anything they want. There should be a do while loop to validate whether the user input is a positive number and add an exit condition. I feel like the calculations.cpp was the hardest peice of code to write, because we not only need to calculate interest under one condition, but rather two conditions with or without additional deposits. Using stack overflow has always been a huge help with my programming, seeing users help with similar problems helped me work through the areas within calculations.cpp that I might have gotten stuck. I beleive building upon this code can transfer to programming for financial institutions like banks and investment firms.
