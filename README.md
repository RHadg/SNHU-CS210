# SNHU-CS210
Project Submission for SNHU CS210
In this project for SNHU we are asked to collaborate with Airgead Banking, one of Chada Tech's clients. This application allows users to see how their investments will grow over time. 
It asks for user input for the initial investment amount, the monthly deposit, annual interest, and number of years the investment grows. The program will then create two displays: the year end balance for each year,
as well as the year end interest earned with and without additional monthly deposits.
